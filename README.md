# MECE-4520-Data-Science-for-Mech-Systems
codes for this course, performing linear and polynomial regression and doing statistical analysis.

HW-2: We uncover what goes behing solving a simple linear/polynomial regresssion problem.

HW-3: We explore the gradient method and PCA method to compress data.

HW-4: Decision Trees and Neural Networks

Final Project: For our final project our team decided to Take on the character recognition problem, for which we wrote a simple Neural network and Also a
               Convolutional Neural Network and then compared both the results.
